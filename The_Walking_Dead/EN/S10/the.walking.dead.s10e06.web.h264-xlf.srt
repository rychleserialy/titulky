1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,952
There is one rule
between our people.

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,787
Stay where you are.

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,748
Yet you disobey.

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:09,859
<i>Previously on
"The Walking Dead"...</i>

5
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,368
The bitch has to die.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,089
The creek,
the border, the tree...

7
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,615
it will crush them.

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,784
- How's Rosita?
- <i>She caught a little bug.</i>

9
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,211
- She okay?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,549
Alright, you big-ass freak.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,526
Let's do this.

12
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,206
Hi.

13
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:07,626
Hey.

14
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,004
Feelin' better?

15
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,231
Yeah. Thanks.

16
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,566
Where you goin'?

17
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:16,159
Mm, gonna do another sweep
for Negan.

18
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,054
Cool.
You want company?

19
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,855
Think Negan
crossed the border?

20
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:31,266
He'd know we couldn't
follow him over there.

21
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:34,177
I can't see him
puttin' on a mask.

22
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,513
Or staying quiet
for long.

23
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:39,075
Still, stranger things
have happened.

24
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,021
We takin' a break?

25
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,523
Nope.

26
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,602
This is
our spot today.

27
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,770
Gonna stay here...

28
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,772
see what we see.

29
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,291
He ain't
gonna wander around,

30
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,718
waitin' to get spotted.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,112
He ain't that dumb.

32
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,114
Neither are you.

33
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,517
Gee, thanks.

34
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,549
You wanna tell me
what we're doin' out here?

35
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,126
Lookin' for Negan.

36
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,311
Right.

37
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,739
You gonna tell me
what we're really lookin' for?

38
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,157
Alpha's horde.

39
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,995
We're gonna find it,
and we're gonna destroy it.

41
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,880
Come on.
Admit it.

42
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:27,358
There's a tiny part of you
that's thrilled to be sick.

43
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,368
Just so you
can spend more time with me.

44
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,405
You think I'm pukin'

45
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,929
because I got
a little crush?

46
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,485
Textbook case
of butterflies in the stomach.

47
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,636
I want
a second opinion.

48
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:43,398
Oh, it's simple science,
darlin'.

49
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,159
Bodies
manifest emotion

50
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,645
in all sorts
of different ways.

51
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,391
The heart wants
what it wants.

52
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,169
Right?
Inhale for me.

53
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,246
Good.

54
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,414
And exhale.

55
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,658
Alright.

56
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,827
Seriously, though,

57
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,406
don't you think we'd make
a bitchin' couple?

58
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,333
Son, I would break you
like a twig.

59
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,077
How's he doin',
Cheryl?

60
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,762
Jury's still out.

61
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,189
Ouch.

62
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,599
I thought we were havin'
a moment here, Cheryl.

63
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,270
Is she okay?
Everything alright?

64
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,530
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,848
Couple more cases
of that stomach bug.

66
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,777
- So that makes it seven.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,038
You know,
maybe I should just

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,373
put Coco down
for a minute...

69
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,824
Don't worry about it,
man.

70
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,543
- I got it.
- Sure?

71
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,694
Yeah.
How's Rosita?

72
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:40,789
Ah, same as everybody else,
it seems.

73
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,699
The most we can do
is keep 'em hydrated

74
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,459
and wait it out.

75
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,036
Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:49,464
Hey, lap up the daddy/daughter
shit while you can,

77
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,226
because they grow
so damn fast.

78
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,882
Okay, a-alright, easy.
Dude, easy.

79
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,476
Have some boundaries.

80
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:02,886
Okay.

81
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,238
My bad.

82
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,481
You two should go out,
have some fun.

83
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,451
Alright, thanks.

84
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,245
And if you need me
to peek at Rosita later,

85
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,971
just say the word.

86
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,898
Happy to,
you know,

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,917
make sure
she's on the mend.

88
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,573
That's one of
those boundaries again.

89
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,408
Yep.

90
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,910
Yeah.

91
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:28,578
Noted.

92
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,038
Alpha's been sending
waves of walkers

93
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,765
to screw with us,
right?

94
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,344
Well, I've been tracking walker
movement along the border.

95
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,845
Small groups.

96
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,588
Some of them might have
Whisperers in them.

97
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,217
But they all connect right back
to this general area,

98
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,761
so I figure
we stake out this spot.

99
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,521
See where
the Whisperers go.

100
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,282
Might lead us
back to the horde.

101
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,933
That's smart.

102
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,285
I thought so.

103
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,012
She's gonna need a place,
though,

104
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,773
like the canyon
they used to be in.

105
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,868
Only spots I know are on
Whisperer territory, though.

106
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,187
Not gonna be able
to sneak in there

107
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,189
without startin' up
some kind of shit.

108
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,783
We only need to figure out
where they are,

109
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,594
and then we'll tell the council.
I swear.

110
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,331
Why weren't you
straight with me before?

111
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,311
After what happened
at the border and with Alpha,

112
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,963
I didn't want you
to worry.

113
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,440
Sorry.

114
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,800
I get it.

115
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,320
Just wanna
keep us safe.

116
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,232
So,
you gonna stick around?

117
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,217
Well, if you
spot somethin',

118
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,220
you're gonna need me
to track it, right?

119
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,497
I dunno.

120
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,983
Picked up a few things
over the years.

121
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,837
Yeah,
we'll see.

122
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:48,825
Honestly,
fellas... or ladies.

123
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,661
Kinda hard to tell
underneath the outfits.

124
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,088
I wanna join,
alright?

125
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,348
I am a joiner.

126
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,850
Get me
a damn application already.

127
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,335
I mean,
look at you guys, right?

128
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,595
Cool-ass outfits,

129
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,839
the whole
back-to-nature paleo vibe?

130
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,008
You are
a survivalist's wet dream.

131
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,011
Not to mention
the number-one selling point...

132
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,605
no more
bein' eaten by the dead.

133
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,608
But just, out of curiosity,
'cause it's killin' me,

134
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,369
what do you got
goin' on down low?

135
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,870
Are you flyin' around
commando-style,

136
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,263
or do you got, like,

137
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,116
walker long johns
with the la... flap?

138
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,286
Whoa.

139
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,621
Cool your tits there,
Jolly Green Giant.

140
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,457
Noise.

141
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:31,034
Constant noise.

142
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:34,296
I should just
slit your throat,

143
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,114
be done with it.

144
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,392
Okay.
You know what?

145
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:41,286
You're right, big man.
I am sorry.

146
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,048
I never
properly introduced myself.

147
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,217
Hey, I'm Negan.

148
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,888
For the last
eight years,

149
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,816
I have been locked up
by your enemy.

150
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,411
So you take me
to your leader,

151
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:02,232
and I will spill
every Goddamn secret I know.

152
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,278
Eugene?

153
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,171
I got
the supplies ya asked for.

154
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,931
Well, feel free
to deposit those

155
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,284
in any location
of your choosin'.

156
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,699
Gotta say, your assist
on the radio relaunch

157
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,609
has been a boon,
and I thank you mightily.

158
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:50,038
Well, I'm happy to be a part
of the Hilltop AV club.

159
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,707
Care to take the new setup
for a spin?

160
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,784
Some primo
choice upgrades.

161
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:57,379
Transmitter's been
properly souped up

162
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,198
with Soviet satellite guts,
and...

163
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,717
You don't
<i>parlez-vous</i> Russian,

164
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,052
by any chance?

165
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,370
<i>Nyet.</i>

166
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,980
Well,
that's all I got.

167
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,582
Hmm. Solid.

168
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,225
Well,
just checkin'.

169
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,878
Relocatin' the antenna
to the apex

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,823
provides unobstructed L-O-S
to the secondary repeater,

171
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,216
exponentially expanding
our range.

172
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,809
You haven't lived

173
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,721
till you've bounced a
transmission off the ionosphere.

174
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,240
Gives me gooseflesh
each and every time.

175
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,742
Well, this sounds really cool,
Eugene,

176
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:30,320
but I gotta get back
to the kids.

177
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,397
Oh, yeah.
Understandable.

178
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,249
Bambinos,
they take precedent.

179
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,510
No expiration
on that invite, though.

180
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,512
Cool. Thanks.

181
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,515
Have fun.

182
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,767
Solo trip it is.

183
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,921
Let's see how far you can fly,
little lady.

184
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,538
<i>Calling for Hilltop.</i>

185
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,206
<i>Come in, Hilltop.</i>

186
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:11,103
<i>Hilltop.
Calling Hilltop.</i>

187
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,288
Copy that,
Alexandria.

188
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,789
This is Hilltop.

189
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,458
<i>Eugene?</i>

190
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,201
Um, yes.

191
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,378
Were you lookin' for someone
in particular?

192
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,038
No, dumbass.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,465
I'm looking for you.

194
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,208
Oh.

195
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,969
Okeydokey.

196
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,899
Just wanted to see
what you were up to.

197
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,233
I figured I'd call.

198
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,894
But I'm also running
a 102-degree fever,

199
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,905
so I could
just be delirious.

200
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,965
What sort of ailments
are we wrestlin' with?

201
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,242
Just a bug.
I'll be fine.

202
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,744
And Coco's okay.

203
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,321
<i>What about you?
What are you up to?</i>

204
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,067
Oh, just some garden-variety
engineerin' advice,

205
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,827
structural
stability checks,

206
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,981
a total revamp
of their radio setup.

207
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,483
<i>Um, everyone wants
a slice of Eugene.</i>

208
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,700
Are you coming back
anytime soon?

209
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,084
To be honest,

210
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,086
I haven't given much thought
to a timetable,

211
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:14,608
but it is mighty good
to hear your voice.

212
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,592
<i>You, too.</i>

213
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,856
Hold on.

214
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,025
We got
a malfunction.

215
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,527
Mother of pearl.

216
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,437
Everything okay?

217
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,272
Bad solder.

218
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,107
It was a gaffe
on my part.

219
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm gonna have to
fix this pronto

220
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,295
before the whole thing
goes FUBAR.

221
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,113
I should
get back into bed anyway.

222
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:38,614
Do you want me to call you
this afternoon?

223
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:41,051
Are radio waves sinusoidal?

224
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,472
Um, yes?

225
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,475
Yes.
Yes, they are.

226
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,645
Ugh.

227
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,272
So close.

228
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,485
Ew.

229
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,896
Ugh.

230
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:05,141
Mr. Crossbow,
I thought aiming was your thing.

231
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:09,746
It's definitely
not your thing.

232
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,408
Mnh-mnh.
Sorry, it doesn't count.

233
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,835
'Course that counts.

234
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,286
No, you gotta
knock the can over.

235
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,321
- You can't just kiss it.
- Oh, my God.

236
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,257
You're such
a sore loser.

237
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,917
I'd have to lose
in order to be a sore loser,

238
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,327
so since
that didn't count,

239
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,904
I'm gonna
take my turn.

240
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:30,166
Oh,
it's a double-capper.

241
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,686
They're good luck.

242
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,747
Maybe it'll help
your aim.

243
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,082
Very funny.

244
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,416
But I'll keep it.

245
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,343
You should watch
your own throws, though.

246
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:42,946
Boom.

247
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,925
How was Hilltop?

248
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,593
It was fine.

249
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,854
King sends his best.

250
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:55,208
Connie fine, too?

251
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,046
What?

252
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,981
I see things.

253
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:03,366
It's not like that.

254
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,776
No?

255
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,721
Not at all.

256
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,374
Why not?

257
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,970
Aren't that many people left
to find out there these days,

258
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,973
much less
good ones like her.

259
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah, I know.

260
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,627
Well, then why not?

261
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,629
What's it matter?

262
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,389
'Cause it does.

263
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,891
You don't
have to be alone.

264
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:32,079
Years pass,
Daryl.

265
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,730
You can't hide out
with your dog forever.

266
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,147
Oh, see?

267
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,317
Your aim's
better already.

268
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,502
I'm hungry.
You got food?

269
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:50,413
Yeah,
I'll get it.

270
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:03,835
Thanks.

271
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,112
Mm-hmm.

272
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,027
Mmm.

273
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,622
Hey,
you see that?

274
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:33,047
It's a Whisperer.

275
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,972
He cannot be trusted.

276
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,050
Dispose of him.

277
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,908
Test him.

278
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,672
If he is worthy,
I will hear him.

279
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,401
If not,
then I kill him.

280
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,745
You have other thoughts?

281
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:16,741
It is a mistake
showing him our ways.

282
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,579
Your questionin'
of my judgment

283
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,915
has become
a regular occurrence.

284
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,359
He is a threat.

285
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,606
To Alpha or to Beta?

286
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,853
I think
only of our people.

287
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,954
Is it finally time

288
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:49,216
for the Beta
to become the Alpha?

289
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,732
Never.

290
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,743
How long you and the boss lady
been together?

291
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,746
Is this, like, a
Beta-with-benefits situation?

292
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,823
Do you slide her a little omega
on the side?

293
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,917
You'll respect
the Alpha,

294
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,402
or I end you
where you stand.

295
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,237
I didn't mean
to offend you.

296
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,757
I mean, hell,
you keep things professional.

297
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,408
I respect that.

298
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,077
Think I was just thrown off
by the whole kneelin' thing.

299
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,972
Not that
there's anything wrong

300
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,932
with the whole
kneelin' thing.

301
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,658
I mean,
that has tickled the dicks

302
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,419
of many a fine man
over the years.

303
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:46,756
Me, myself, I used to
have people kneelin' for me

304
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,257
all the livelong day,

305
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:49,776
so I do understand
the benefits

306
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,020
that sort of shit
provides.

307
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:55,156
Just actually
never done the deed myself.

308
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,286
And I admire
your self-restraint,

309
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,788
and I'm sayin' this
totally respectfully,

310
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,682
but there is somethin' about
that whole bald-head thing

311
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,442
that just

312
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,461
tightens my britches.

313
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,448
Rosita? Gabriel?

314
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,593
Just wanted to swing by to grab
a change of clothes for Coco.

315
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:19,472
Hey, you.

316
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,975
I think I need
a house call, Doc.

317
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,310
Hm.

318
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,386
I thought we were
supposed to be in bed.

319
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:28,130
I was,
and then I was feeling better,

320
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,465
so I came downstairs.

321
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,133
And then
I was feeling even worse,

322
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,710
so now I'm stuck.

323
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,547
Well, you shoulda called Gabe
to come get me.

324
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,474
Ah, the Good Shepherd
is out on patrol.

325
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,884
Overnighter.

326
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,828
Okay.

327
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,831
Well, field trip
to the infirmary.

328
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,241
No, come on, Siddiq.
I have so much to do.

329
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,002
I know,
like going to the infirmary.

330
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,486
No, no, no, no.

331
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,839
If you just help me
get to the garage so...

332
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,249
Yeah.

333
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,159
Shit.

334
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,736
No. Okay.

335
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,089
Look,
it's a crazy idea,

336
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:05,076
but how about we all go
to the infirmary?

337
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,745
Mm? Yeah?
Coco says yeah.

338
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,338
Let's go.

339
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,417
Easy.

340
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,280
This is Hilltop callin' over
to Alexandria.

341
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,766
Do you copy?

342
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,549
Alexandria, let us know
if you are receivin'.

343
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,555
Alexandria proper,
please respond.

344
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,146
Greetings.

345
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,907
This is Tater Bug,
callin' live over open channels.

346
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,225
Anyone out there,
give us a copy.

347
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,403
It's getting bigger.

348
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:17,649
Yeah, looks like they're
gatherin' up all the strays.

349
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,575
Well,
once the sun goes down,

350
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,335
it's gonna be tough
to see where they go

351
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,337
unless
we can get closer.

352
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,491
What makes you think
they're goin' anywhere?

353
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,751
If you and me
were Whisperers,

354
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,586
that's when
we'd move 'em.

355
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,189
You know I'm right.

356
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,092
You wanna cross the border,
don't ya?

357
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:39,687
I wanna find the horde.
If that's what it takes...

358
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:42,598
Sure this isn't you

359
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,117
just tryin'
to take another shot at Alpha?

360
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,177
The horde is our shot.

361
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,121
You changin' your mind?

362
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,365
Nope.
I didn't say that.

363
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,852
Then what's the problem?

364
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:59,707
Alright, we do this,
we gotta be smart about it.

365
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,376
None of this "runnin' off
in the middle of the night,

366
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,862
no backup, just us"
stuff, alright?

367
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,625
Since when
are we not enough?

368
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,871
You know,
we mess this up,

369
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,650
everyone else
is gonna pay for it, right?

370
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,560
We've already paid.

371
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,987
We keep paying

372
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,065
no matter what
side of the line we're on.

373
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,727
I gotta pee.

374
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,182
Did you find
what you were lookin' for?

375
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,539
You bring the gun?

376
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,448
No.

377
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,060
Used up all the ammunition,
remember?

378
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:20,046
There was still some ammo left
in the storage room.

379
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,108
I didn't
bring the gun, Daryl.

380
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,052
Wanna frisk me?

381
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,054
Go ahead.

382
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,631
Okay.

383
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,973
Either we're enough,
or we're not.

384
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,071
Alright,
let's do it.

385
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,390
A plan this stupid,
might as well be us.

386
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:11,780
So,
do I get bathed

387
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:16,281
and reborn
in her Whisper-y image,

388
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:18,786
or is this more like
a ball-trippin',

389
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,399
skin-themed vision quest?

390
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:24,068
Dig.

391
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,672
That's it?

392
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,191
I can do that.

393
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,200
Anything in particular
we're goin' for here?

394
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:40,793
Size, depth, width?

395
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,612
Just dig.

396
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,785
Alright.

397
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,880
Deeper?

398
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,610
Sure. Why not?

399
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,356
Watch your step.

400
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,842
Here we go.

401
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,952
Yeah. Okay.

402
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,363
Looks like
I'm not the only one.

403
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,956
Yeah.

404
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,276
Let's get you
a seat.

405
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,961
Dante?

406
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,205
Go ahead
and grab a seat wherever.

407
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:34,375
I'll be with you
in a sec.

408
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:37,044
Dante, what the hell
is goin' on?

409
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,379
Hey, guys.

410
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,698
I-I-I think the illness
is spreading

411
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,049
faster than
we thought.

412
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,551
I-I didn't want
to bother you.

413
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:46,220
That is not a decision
you get to make.

414
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:48,964
Damn it, man, this is why I said
I shouldn't leave.

415
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,632
- Hey, Siddiq, he's...
- What?

416
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,610
He's tryin' to help.

417
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:57,381
Start crushing herbs...

418
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,899
ginger and mint
for the nausea

419
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,993
and oil of oregano
and yarrow for the fever.

420
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,720
Alright.

421
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:05,623
This is only gonna get worse
if we're not ahead of it.

422
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,410
You good
with these rules?

423
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,896
Yeah.
Don't be seen.

424
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:15,232
No tracks,
no killin' walkers neither.

425
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,901
Find a bunch of bodies
with holes in their heads,

426
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,420
we might as well leave a note
saying we were here.

427
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,908
Watch, learn, leave.

428
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,668
Yeah, if things go sideways,
we head back.

429
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,171
We get split up,

430
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,915
you meet me
right here, alright?

431
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,249
Yeah.

432
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,086
And be safe.

433
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:38,364
We got luck on our side,
alright?

434
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,925
Come on.

435
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,444
My porky here,

436
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,930
he was a bastard
to take down.

437
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,449
But I gotta say, this is exactly
the kind of badass shit

438
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:50,042
I will do
for my new family.

439
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,936
Only those
who have earned

440
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,881
the right
to walk among us may eat.

441
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,958
Earned?

442
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,701
Big man,

443
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:03,723
I helped kill
and cook the damn pig.

444
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,892
Come on, man, alright?

445
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,226
At the very least,

446
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,137
I deserve
a piece of bacon.

447
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,901
Whatever you say,
boss.

448
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,354
This is Tater Bug over open air,

449
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:03,115
surfin' on
these proverbial radio waves.

450
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,767
Any interested earholes,
come on back.

451
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,535
Anyone anywhere?

452
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:17,755
This is Tater Bug.

453
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,788
<i>Hello?</i>

454
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,790
<i>Hello, Tater Bug?</i>

455
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,036
<i>I receive you
loud and clear.</i>

456
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,555
<i>I-I can't believe this.</i>

457
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:38,042
<i>Are you...
Are you really out there?</i>

458
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,775
Not here.

459
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,891
Keep looking.

460
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,476
Well, had I considered
the prospect of first contact,

461
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:04,236
I would've prepared
proper remarks

462
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,813
toward the establishin'
of relations.

463
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:07,481
Over.

464
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,558
<i>I don't quite know
what to say, either.</i>

465
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,151
<i>I'd gotten
to the point</i>

466
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:12,727
<i>where I figured
this was a waste of time.</i>

467
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,972
<i>Over.</i>

468
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:18,084
Well, perhaps an exchange
of Q&As might grease the wheels.

469
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,977
A few
right off the top of my dome...

470
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,571
where are you located,
how long have you been there,

471
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,090
how many people
do you have,

472
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,592
and should we continue
saying "over"?

473
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,243
Over.

474
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:31,263
<i>We can probably make do
without the "overs."</i>

475
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,748
<i>As for
the other stuff,</i>

476
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,344
<i>I don't think I'm comfortable
sharing that just yet.</i>

477
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,271
Understandable.

478
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,516
Any alts more within
your zone of comfort?

479
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:45,969
<i>Maybe talk about our lives
before all this?</i>

480
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,598
My personal origin entails
a long and storied history.

481
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,008
Were you thinkin' prologue,

482
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,934
or should I skip ahead
a few chapters?

483
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:55,770
<i>I guess, uh,
start with where you're from.</i>

484
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,123
Certainly.

485
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,016
A Lone Star child
at heart,

486
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,185
I was born
in the shadows of Big D.

487
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,871
That's a well-worn nickname
for Dallas, Texas.

488
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:05,631
<i>Yeah,
I picked up on that.</i>

489
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,466
<i>I grew up
in Pennsylvania,</i>

490
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,543
<i>a small town
called Strasburg.</i>

491
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:12,029
Uh,
dubious as it may seem,

492
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,306
I know
Strasburg, Pennsylvania, well.

493
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,034
- <i>Sure you do.</i>
- True as Coventry blue.

494
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,310
Durin' adolescence,

495
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,795
I went through
a significant foamer phase.

496
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:23,040
Locomotives were my jam.

497
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,558
As such,
my parents purchased

498
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,153
a pair of tickets
to the 1995 Trainfan Expo

499
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,138
at the Railroad Museum
in, well, you guessed it.

500
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,174
<i>Strasburg, Pennsylvania.</i>

501
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,492
<i>Whoa.</i>

502
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,811
I have the most vivid memory
of an ice-cream shop

503
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:40,666
with the most marvelous batch
of black raspberry ice cream.

504
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,001
<i>The Inside Scoop.</i>

505
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,818
<i>Went there all the time.</i>

506
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,256
<i>Hell, you and I might've
been there on the same day.</i>

507
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,250
Well,
knowin' this,

508
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,419
there's a critical question
needs answerin'.

509
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:53,679
<i>What's that?</i>

510
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,831
Cake cone or waffle?

511
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:18,913
Been decades
since I got this much attention

512
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:20,915
from younger men.

513
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,676
Well,
you're my patient,

514
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:26,680
so it's kinda my job
to keep an eye on you.

515
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,441
Then what's with the look
of gloom and doom?

516
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:33,445
I feel like I'm nappin'
next to the grim reaper.

517
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:38,266
Sorry.

518
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:40,452
Sorry.

519
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:45,124
I'm just,
um, a little concerned.

520
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:50,704
Oh, hon, in this world,
most don't get the luxury

521
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:54,300
of driftin' off
in a nice, comfy bed.

522
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:57,619
I should be
so lucky.

523
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,352
Get some rest.

524
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,464
Hey, hey,
I'll get it for you.

525
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,891
Oh, thanks, man.

526
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:16,739
About what I said earlier,
I, um...

527
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,641
No worries.

528
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:21,218
I get it.

529
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,330
We're stuck with
pre-industrial-age meds,

530
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:28,334
and simple shit can suddenly
become a big deal.

531
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,502
We'll figure it out.

532
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,505
Thanks, Dante.

533
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,592
I-I appreciate
your help.

534
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:41,513
You should.

535
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,908
I'm kind of amazing.

536
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:49,763
Get some rest,
boss.

537
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,358
Alright, come on.

538
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,530
Mm.

539
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,206
Hey, Coco.

540
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,540
Hey.

541
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,542
It's okay.

542
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,786
It's okay.
Shh.

543
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:14,546
Aww, it's okay.

544
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,273
Uh, Daddy gotcha.

545
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,291
Oh, it's alright.

546
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:21,278
Hey.
Hey, it's okay.

547
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,554
Hey.

548
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,965
No, no, no, no.

549
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,226
Oh, it's okay.

550
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,565
There you go.

551
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:14,331
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

552
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,854
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

553
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:26,100
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

554
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,134
Clearly,
we are not jivin'.

555
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:02,379
And, you know,
to be honest with you,

556
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,897
I totally understand
the position you're in.

557
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,306
You gotta be, like,

558
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,141
the tough guy
and keep everybody in line.

559
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:08,719
I mean,
hell, you know,

560
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:12,331
I had guys just like you
to keep my shit tight.

561
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,149
Alright,
maybe not just like you.

562
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:17,503
Uh, hell, if I had some monster
your size,

563
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,671
things would've
turned out different.

564
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,990
Look,
whether you like me or not,

565
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:23,917
I will be joinin'
this team,

566
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,586
so maybe we should find a way
to get along, you know,

567
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:28,663
and stop pissin'
on each other's boots.

568
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:32,518
You will never
be one of us.

569
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,687
You're too loud,

570
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:41,585
too weak,
too full of ego.

571
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,695
I mean,
it ain't ego

572
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,922
if I really am
that awesome.

573
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,426
You are a waste,

574
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,854
and Alpha
will see it.

575
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:55,949
So cards on the table,
then?

576
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:58,101
Cool.
I dig that.

577
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,787
See,
I'm not here for you.

578
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,789
I am here for Alpha.

579
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,049
So you go ahead,

580
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,109
and you throw
your little tests at me

581
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,886
and you scowl

582
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,722
and throw me on the ground like
a five-and-dime Frankenstein.

583
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,559
I don't give a shit.

584
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:16,210
See, big man,

585
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,730
I ain't goin' anywhere.

586
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,734
Finally,

587
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,738
something we can
both agree on.

588
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,558
You won't be
going anywhere.

589
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,748
Wait a minute.

590
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,419
Did you just make
a Goddamn joke?

591
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,588
I would be impressed

592
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,240
if I wasn't
so pissed off right now.

593
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,913
You have got
to be shittin' me.

594
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,120
What the hell
is this?

595
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,455
He saw me.

596
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,865
We can take him back,
see what he knows.

597
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:20,183
Maybe it's a good thing.

598
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,520
Did you plan this?

599
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,372
No.

600
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:30,861
What's this?

601
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:35,031
It wasn't
in your bag.

602
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,125
Guess you missed it.

603
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,536
Come on.
We don't have time to argue.

604
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,054
It's done.

605
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:54,142
Roller rinks never made much
dollars-and-centavos sense

606
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:56,403
to me, purely on
a risk/reward analysis.

607
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:59,406
<i>Too afraid of falling?</i>

608
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,559
Injury combined
with humiliation.

609
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,504
Not my favorite pastime.

610
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,471
This deet exchange
on our formatives

611
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:18,684
has been
very enjoyable, and...

612
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:22,579
at the risk
of said humiliation,

613
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,191
I wonder if we could dip
our toes into some real talk.

614
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:32,180
<i>I...</i>

615
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:36,702
<i>It's been great,
honestly.</i>

616
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:39,779
<i>But I don't
really know you.</i>

617
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:41,948
<i>You might be a threat.</i>

618
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:45,711
<i>Maybe it's better</i>

619
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:50,123
<i>if we let this be,
you know, what it is.</i>

620
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:58,965
What if I were
to share specifics?

621
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:02,969
<i>Who's to say
I'm not a threat to you?</i>

622
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:07,457
<i>People are dangerous.</i>

623
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,460
I'm well aware.

624
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:14,222
And yet,
I have a twinge in my belly

625
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,224
that says
you lean toward

626
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:19,227
the "good" column
of the alignment chart.

627
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:21,562
I do know you.

628
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:29,479
My given name
is Eugene Hermann Porter,

629
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,999
and I propose we continue
these convos on the reg,

630
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,427
with the hopes
of buildin' more.

631
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,004
Should that meet
with your approval

632
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:41,266
and/or interest,
of course.

633
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:02,512
<i>Hello,
Eugene Hermann Porter.</i>

634
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,015
<i>I'd like that.</i>

635
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:08,368
<i>I'd like that
very much indeed.</i>

636
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,798
So we're in agreement,
then.

637
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,525
<i>We are.</i>

638
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:22,290
<i>But... But let's just keep this
between us for now.</i>

639
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:25,293
<i>I wanna trust you,</i>

640
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:28,872
<i>but if I hear anyone else,
I'll know I can't.</i>

641
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:33,543
<i>And you'll never
hear from me again.</i>

642
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:39,215
Okay,
just you and me.

643
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,826
Copy that.

644
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:43,403
Over.

645
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:05,333
He was weak.

646
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:08,836
I expected more.

647
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,189
He will serve us better
as one of the dead.

648
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,933
I'm ready
for my Goddamn skin suit.

649
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:17,587
You best bring
that extra-long tape measure

650
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:22,350
on account
of my humongous balls.

651
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:28,707
Hi.
I'm Negan.

652
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,951
We haven't
formally met,

653
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:34,954
but I sure as hell
know who you are.

654
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:42,779
And whether my reputation
precedes me or not...

655
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,788
...I'm all in.

656
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,142
Whatever you want,
whatever I got,

657
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:58,552
it's yours.

658
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:24,095
Shh.

659
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:31,033
