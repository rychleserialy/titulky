00:00:02,626 --> 00:00:03,774
Kindred has been involved

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:06,796
with kidnapping, burglary, two murders.

4
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,382
You don't have anything.

5
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:12,429
Life, as you know it... is gonna change.

Alan Wilkis. My anonymous source

7
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:15,602
when I first investigated Kindred.

8
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,632
- He's dead?
- Sailing accident.

9
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:19,656
- Look into it.
- Cancer's back.

10
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,481
We did this before. We can do it again.

11
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:22,539
Not this time, honey.

12
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,023
You don't have to decide right now.

13
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,181
- Does she know what she is?
- No.

14
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,257
Telling an AI it's an AI

15
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,359
effectively destroys the program.

16
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:33,007
I wanted us to have
somewhere where we could talk.

17
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,117
Why don't I remember you when I go back?

18
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:36,507
This is just for us.

19
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:37,861
Something's wrong.

20
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,476
Grandpa, wake up!

21
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,796
You have to tell the truth.

22
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,718
Do you have superpowers?

23
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,087
Focus.

24
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:57,703
Calm your mind.

25
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:01,054
Now...

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,496
move the cupcake.

27
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:08,311
Is it moving?

28
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,303
Not yet.

29
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,056
It's not working.

30
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:16,570
Don't give up.

31
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:19,969
Just imagine in your mind

32
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:22,127
like it's floating off the floor.

33
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,301
Think about it, Piper.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,234
Mia, hurry up!

35
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,773
- What was that?!
- Nothing! Nothing!

I'm letting Mia stay
home from school today.

38
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:58,974
Alleged stomachache.

39
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,609
Smart choice. Vague symptoms.

40
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,499
Yeah, it's fine.

41
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,956
We could all use a day off.

42
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:17,670
Don't you have to get going?

43
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,595
No, it's fine. I got time.

44
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,875
You're okay with both girls
today, right?

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,521
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:27,069
Maybe I'll just... tell them today.

47
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:35,452
I can see you're not
in love with that idea.

48
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:38,950
I just think it's too soon, Dad.
I think we should wait.

49
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,224
Too soon for what?

50
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,897
For me to change my mind?

51
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:46,835
I just want you to consider
all of your options.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,426
Honey, I have.

53
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,139
And I can't do it.

54
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,205
More chemo is just...

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,305
There's things other than chemo.

56
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,986
There's clinical trials
and alternative medicine.

57
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,544
I'm okay with this.

58
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,981
And I can see that you're not,

59
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:03,606
and I am sorry about that, but...

60
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:06,151
You know what? We don't have to
talk about this right now, okay?

61
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:12,191
Okay, I won't tell them.

62
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,278
Okay, good.

63
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,723
I'll see you tonight.

64
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,856
Okay, have a good day.

65
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:32,412
Hey, uh, that from the Coast Guard?

66
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,637
- Yeah. Just came in.
- Thanks.

67
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,850
How long is she gonna stay here?

68
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,376
Oh, uh, well, it's protective custody,

69
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,102
so she'll be here until we're
sure Kindred can't get to her.

70
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,368
Mm-hmm. I'm just saying,
this is not a hotel,

71
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,626
and I'm not the maid.

72
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,382
- No, un... understood.
- Mm.

73
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,914
We're out of creamer.

74
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,172
Bite me.

75
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,946
Um, morning, Chief.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,305
- Morning.
- Hey, um, the Coast Guard

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,497
sent the report on the Wilkis death.

78
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,622
September 2015, Wilkis set sail

79
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,411
despite a marine warning that day.

80
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:07,414
Coast Guard found the boat
adrift with a broken mast

81
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,371
off the coast of Delaware
about a week later.

82
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:11,171
Never found a body.

83
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,654
Is there any evidence someone
was on the boat with him?

84
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:16,522
No, whole deck got swamped.
Everything washed away.

85
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,911
I'll talk to the widow.
You canvass the marina.

86
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,083
Four years is a long time,

87
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,172
but maybe somebody remembers
if they saw him with anyone.

88
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,272
Okay.

89
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,335
We need to discuss the water
pressure in your shower.

90
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,693
I know. I'm so excited to do that.

91
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:32,338
It's at the top of my list.

92
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:41,914
That boat was everything to him.

93
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,539
Then the job.

94
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:47,353
I was a... distant third, probably.

95
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,512
Is it possible someone else
was on the boat with him

96
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:50,602
when he disappeared?

97
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:51,893
I can't imagine.

98
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,688
He wouldn't even take me.

99
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,754
Liked the solitude.

100
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,264
So there's no chance he
was with Richard Kindred?

101
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,166
Uh, no.

102
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,924
Zero chance of that.

103
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:04,184
Is this about the break-in?

104
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:07,210
I told the police, nothing was taken.

105
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,133
We have reason to suspect
that your husband...

106
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:12,827
might have been murdered.

107
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,377
By Dicky Kindred?

108
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:21,387
No. Never.

109
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,788
Why?

110
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:26,181
That would be tantamount to
killing the golden goose.

111
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,830
You wanna know a big secret
about Richard Kindred?

112
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,355
He's a fraud. A con man.

113
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,370
He doesn't know the first
thing about technology.

114
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,232
That is not at all surprising.

115
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,964
Did you know that your
husband tried to change

116
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:43,622
the terms of his
contract before he died?

117
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:46,338
His stock options would've gone to you.

118
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,093
Instead, they went to Kindred.

119
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,656
No, I did not know that.

120
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:55,083
But that just reinforces my theory.

121
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,357
I suspect Alan killed himself.

122
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,436
Why would you think that?

123
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:01,944
He fixed that door.

124
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,850
Used to stick all the time, for years.

125
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:08,364
A few weeks before he died, he fixed it.

126
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,708
Looking back now,
I think he was saying goodbye.

127
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,007
I arrested Kindred,
and then I let him go.

128
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:19,499
And someone just broke into your house.

129
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,052
This is not a coincidence.

130
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,988
What might Kindred
have been looking for?

131
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,257
I guess his research.

132
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,325
But Alan never brought any of that home.

133
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,974
He never even talked about work.

134
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:37,625
All that knowledge... died with him.

135
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:49,852
Do you know how to ride a bike?

136
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,194
Um... I don't know.

137
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,318
We're gonna find out,

138
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,759
because Dad's coming
over to check on me,

139
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,062
and then you and I are leaving.

140
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,670
Aren't we gonna get in trouble?

141
00:06:58,695 --> 00:06:59,847
No.

142
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:03,307
Because we're gonna be
very quick and very quiet.

143
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,826
Hello.

144
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,144
It's nice to see you again.

145
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:27,875
Why am I here?

146
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,648
What do you think?

147
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,092
You brought me.

148
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,812
Not entirely.

149
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,959
I sort of invited you.

150
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,297
But you wouldn't be here
if you didn't want to be.

151
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,890
But... why this place?

152
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:47,782
I always feel peaceful when I'm here.

153
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,019
Calm.

154
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,711
I can be myself.

155
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,557
And you can be yourself, too.

156
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:56,383
But...

157
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:59,055
this place isn't real.

158
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,475
What makes you say that?

159
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,850
My God.

160
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,229
You are so smart.

161
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,297
Why this place?

162
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,374
Jo showed me a picture of it.

163
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,352
She said they used to go fishing here.

164
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,477
You like Jo a lot, don't you?

165
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,469
Yes.

166
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:40,991
Why?

167
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,186
She feels like home.

168
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,172
Hmm.

169
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,860
Maybe someday,

170
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,577
you'll feel the same way about me.

171
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,727
Mia's waiting for me.

172
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,490
Then you should go.

173
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,095
I'll see you very soon.

174
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,508
You seem to want to provoke me.

175
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:26,850
Well... it's not not fun.

176
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,858
You're not a prisoner, Emily.

177
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,547
I'd like to keep you
safe, but I'm not gonna

178
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,085
force you to stay here
if you don't want to.

179
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,961
How was the widow?

180
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,466
I don't know. Sad.

181
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:40,032
She thinks Wilkis killed himself.

182
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,947
It's possible.

183
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,694
He had the mind of a god

184
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:48,077
but the emotional stability of a ferret.

185
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:52,524
Still, I think he was too much
of a narcissist for suicide.

186
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,062
You know...

187
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:56,046
he designed her.

188
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,951
Is that so?

189
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,609
Not the physical body... the AI.

190
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,969
He dedicated his whole life to it.

191
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,538
By the end, he despised it.

192
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,630
He destroyed all of the source code

193
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,955
so that no one else could replicate it.

194
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,218
So how did Kindred get his hands on it?

195
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,509
My guess?

196
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,648
Threatened to kill him
unless he forked it over...

197
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,828
then killed him anyway.

198
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:23,764
Hey, uh... you're not
gonna believe this.

199
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,724
Alan Wilkis is...

200
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,081
alive.

201
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,622
Oh, hey. How's the patient?

202
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,381
Award-winning performance.

203
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,262
She's fine.

204
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,480
All this looks like a nightmare.

205
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,207
Oh, no, it's great.

206
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,661
I went from seven remotes
all the way down to four.

207
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,013
I got the instructions right here.
Want me to run you through it?

208
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,263
That's a big pass.

209
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,645
You hungry? I make
a dynamite grilled cheese.

210
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:51,670
You sound real busted up
about losing your job.

211
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:54,326
Yeah. I deserve some time off.

212
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,584
Uh-huh, spoken like a trust fund kid.

213
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:57,988
Also true.

214
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,424
Well...

215
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:03,608
you can make me lunch,
or we can just cut to the part

216
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,240
where you try to talk me
into doing more chemo.

217
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,482
Mm-hmm. I know she sent you.

218
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,583
Yeah.

219
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,082
- She loves you.
- I know.

220
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,067
- We all do.
- Never doubted it.

221
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:16,652
It's just that she doesn't understand
why you didn't talk to her.

222
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,661
It's like... you made the decision

223
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,990
without even thinking about her.

224
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,165
Yeah, I didn't think of her.

225
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,248
You know what? I...

226
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,905
That was a mistake. I'm sorry.

227
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,881
How often do you think of your daughter?

228
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:34,964
Hmm? Rough guess.

229
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,588
50% of the time?

230
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,631
80?

231
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,334
Yeah. You're right. I know.

232
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,364
- It's just, I...
- Did you think about her

233
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,663
when you and Jo decided to split up?

234
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,389
Eh, you guys just did
what you needed to do.

235
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,897
Even if Mia got hurt,
and Mia did get hurt.

236
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:54,183
And I didn't chime in
with my opinion because...

237
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,885
it just wasn't my business.

238
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,270
Ed, I'm still here.

239
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:00,912
I didn't leave.

240
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,176
I didn't give up.

241
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,657
Ask Mia if that's what she thinks.

242
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,457
How'd you find him?

243
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,748
I followed the boat.

244
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:22,205
It was sold at auction about a
year after Wilkis disappeared.

245
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,474
Buyer was an anonymous
LLC called Vector.

246
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,098
That was his cat's name.

247
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,223
Okay, uh, yeah, the boat itself

248
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:31,356
was renamed the Ashley Grace
and moored in North Carolina.

249
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,137
That's from two weeks ago.

250
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:36,122
The harbormaster says that
he pays cash, keeps to himself,

251
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:38,193
and goes sailing a few times a year.

252
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,600
- Old habits.
- Get you caught.

253
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,512
Great work.

254
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:43,725
Thanks.

255
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,489
I need you to reach out to him.

256
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,342
Our only method of communicating
was through a dark web forum.

257
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:50,747
I can send him a message,

258
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,178
but typically, he took weeks to respond.

259
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,412
You have bait now.

260
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,950
I need him to take a hike.

261
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:01,247
Excuse me?

262
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,616
Chris, why don't you
go get a cup of coffee?

263
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,656
Show Wilkis the AI.

264
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,763
Show him what he created.

265
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:22,043
He won't be able to resist.

266
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,740
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Something like that?

267
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,755
<i>Okay, like that.</i>

268
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,796
I think I figured it out.

269
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,457
You can move metal with your mind.

270
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,859
Like Magneto.

271
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,650
What's a Magneto?

272
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,779
Doesn't matter.

273
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,311
Okay.

274
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,401
Do it.

275
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,825
I'm afraid.

276
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,541
Piper.

277
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,724
It's just you and me.

278
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:00,519
And if you can learn
how to control this,

279
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:01,838
that's a good thing.

280
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:03,622
Okay.

281
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,234
Is it working?

282
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,950
Yeah.

283
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,380
Keep going.

284
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,710
This is amazing.

285
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,311
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

286
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:46,483
It's okay, it's okay.

287
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:47,975
It was an accident.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,342
Is it broken?

289
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:52,083
- We need to go home.
- No. No.

290
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,627
No.

291
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,008
I have a better idea.

292
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,364
- Okay.
- Okay.

293
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,348
And they want you to pick a
date for a community meeting

294
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,442
about the uptick in vehicle break-ins.

295
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,433
Daph, can you just give me a minute?

296
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,391
- Sure. No problem.
- Thanks.

297
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:11,732
Hey, Chris. Why don't you
come on in and have a seat?

298
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,520
Hey, uh, I just want to say that, uh,

299
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,809
if there's something
that I've been doing

300
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:19,201
that makes you question my judgment
or question your trust in me,

301
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,749
then I would like to have some feedback,

302
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,538
because I feel like I-I've
been sidelined here,

303
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,161
and I don't really know why.

304
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,599
You're right.

305
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:29,795
That was a crappy thing to do,
and I'm sorry.

306
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,024
So, you want to... want to tell me
what that was all about?

307
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,897
Why don't you take a seat?

308
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,341
I have been...

309
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,427
keeping something from you.

310
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:51,419
From... everyone, really.

311
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:55,155
The only people who know
are Emily and Benny.

312
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,136
Um, and Kindred.

313
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:00,223
And I trust you a hell of a lot
more than I trust any of them.

314
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:02,064
So I am gonna...

315
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,116
bring you up to speed.

316
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:05,737
- Okay?
- All right.

317
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:08,069
Okay.

318
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,276
Alan Wilkis...

319
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,776
designed an AI program.

320
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:27,298
Emily's idea to draw him out

321
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,370
was to send him a video...

322
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,230
of Piper.

323
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,714
Because...

324
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:39,159
she's a product...

325
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,392
of that design.

326
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,564
Piper's AI.

327
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,164
Okay. Got it.

328
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,923
I'm s... You've got... You've got...

329
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:04,792
Your response is... Is y-you've got it?

330
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,385
Uh, yep. Totally clear.

331
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,410
Yeah.

332
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:11,485
Chris, I don't think...
I mean, I'm... I'm not...

333
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,698
I-I'm not sure... Do you... Do you...

334
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,745
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

335
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,253
Yeah, artificial intelligence. I'm good.

336
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:25,937
Well, you're taking this... very well.

337
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,266
Yeah.

338
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,964
Yeah.

339
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,181
Probably later, I'll... I'll freak out

340
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,362
and question the universe
and my place in it.

341
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,948
That sort of thing.

342
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,673
Okay.

343
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,440
Uh...

344
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,659
Piper doesn't know.

345
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:46,901
She cannot know.

346
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,378
I haven't told Alex or Mia.

347
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,128
My dad.

348
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:57,230
Uh, and I'm not going to,
because I can't risk anybody...

349
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,472
letting something slip.

350
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,007
I understand.

351
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:05,956
Sorry, Chief. Uh, delivery.

352
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,597
Yeah, package for Benny Gallagher.

353
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,284
Yeah, I'll... I'll take it.

354
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:15,177
Benny's getting mail here now?

355
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:20,088
Brookhaven Central Bus Terminal.

356
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,628
Alan Wilkis just wrote back.

357
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,798
<i>... 467 arriving from Stanford
is delayed by 18 minutes.</i>

358
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:32,142
<i>Bus 467 arriving from Stanford
delayed by 18 minutes.</i>

359
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,933
Locker 424.

360
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:36,018
I haven't seen anyone near it.

361
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,722
Let's see what he left for us.

362
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,982
"Leave cellphones and weapons here.

363
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,473
Further instructions to follow."

364
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:50,864
Come on. You're kidding.

365
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,617
He's watching us.

366
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,837
All right.

367
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:06,417
Well, I guess I'll contact
you as soon as I'm able.

368
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,667
What, are you just gonna go alone?

369
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:13,064
Well, I assume a no-gun,
no-communication scavenger hunt

370
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,486
is a bridge too far for you.

371
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,945
All he had to do was stay quiet.

372
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,319
Just... not respond to your message.

373
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,183
We would never have found him.

374
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,111
He's got something to say.

375
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:33,167
I want to hear what it is.

376
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,245
"Space 181.

377
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,183
Keys under seat."

378
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:09,519
No GPS.

379
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:10,876
No Bluetooth.

380
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,093
No one will know where we are.

381
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,885
I told Chris to check
in every half-hour.

382
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,347
He'll know something's up
when he can't reach me.

383
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,909
And do what?

384
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,550
Excellent police work.

385
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,358
Here you go.

386
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:32,987
All right.

387
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,855
"Route 301.

388
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,425
Mile marker 14.

389
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,745
Do not deviate from map.
Do not contact anyone.

390
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,425
You have three hours."

391
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,136
Hi!

392
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,127
Mia, what... what's going on?

393
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,831
We were riding our bikes...

394
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,776
and... I fell.

395
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,870
And I figured, you know,

396
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,183
since your house is so close by...

397
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,183
Why... Why aren't you in school?

398
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,831
She's sick.

399
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,206
I mean... but she got better.

400
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,008
Hmm.

401
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,550
"Walk 1,200 yards.

402
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,472
38 degrees northeast."

403
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,734
We're close.

404
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,007
I think.

405
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,473
Close to what?

406
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,577
A very good spot to bury our bodies.

407
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,180
He's not gonna resurrect
himself from the dead

408
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,537
just to kill us.

409
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,094
This might be our only chance
to get something on Kindred,

410
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:21,687
something that actually sticks.

411
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,382
Plus, I want to ask him about this.

412
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,171
Piper's program.

413
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:29,156
He needs to explain how it works,

414
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,242
what I can expect moving forward.

415
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,577
Is she gonna grow or stay the same?

416
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,054
I just...

417
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,515
I need to know what I'm into.

418
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:38,882
So...

419
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,054
why'd you and Alex split up?

420
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,452
- Nope.
- Very good.

421
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:44,968
And... that's about 1,200 yards.

422
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:52,041
And there's nothing here.

423
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:57,273
What is that?

424
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,601
Is that a camera?

425
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,355
Where the hell are we?

426
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,526
Damn it.

427
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:52,551
What?

428
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,214
He got the disk.

429
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,284
And my gun.

430
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,784
You had another gun?

431
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,409
I'd have quite liked to have known that.

432
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,206
I've been here before.

433
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,636
What do you mean?

434
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,893
It's the view from my beach house.

435
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:30,690
Little blood in your ears
from the sound cannon.

436
00:24:30,715 --> 00:24:31,760
No permanent damage.

437
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:33,185
Clean yourself up.

438
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:40,494
You wanna maybe tell me
why that was necessary?

439
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,440
Do you wanna tell me
why you brought a weapon

440
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,065
when explicitly instructed not to?

441
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,330
Okay, just to be clear,
I had no idea that she had a gun.

442
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:49,354
Well, you've done a
disservice to yourself.

443
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,879
A bad first impression.

444
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:53,204
A bad f...
What am I, applying for a job?

445
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,528
Where's the disk?

446
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:59,135
It's nice. Sophisticated technology.

447
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Who designed it?

448
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,185
Kindred.

449
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,213
That's a lie.

450
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:04,049
- Did you look at it?
- No.

451
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:06,260
The little girl in the video you saw...

452
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,010
That's her.

453
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:12,104
If what you're saying is true,
that is not a little girl.

454
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,159
That's the end of the world.

455
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,323
And there's no way in hell
Richard Kindred designed it.

456
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,479
My understanding is you did.

457
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:19,604
No, I... tried to prevent this.

458
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:21,402
I destroyed everything...
My entire life's work...

459
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:22,426
To stop this.

460
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:25,768
Well, Mr. Wilkis,
somebody took all that work,

461
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,877
and they made a 10-year-old.

462
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:33,932
Can you do this?

463
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:36,924
And this?

464
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,211
And that?

465
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:43,151
Okay. Come on.

466
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,108
Tell me what happened.

467
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,466
I fell.

468
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,971
And then there was just,
like, this big rock,

469
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,815
and my arm hit it.

470
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,158
A big rock?

471
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,465
Yes.

472
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:02,252
And why aren't you in school?

473
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:05,033
Well, I had a stomachache,
and then I felt better,

474
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,307
and Piper wanted to go bike riding.

475
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,518
Hmm. And your grandfather
was okay with that?

476
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:11,076
Mm-hmm.

477
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,018
Um, Mia said that...

478
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:17,994
he wouldn't mind.

479
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,635
Hey, so, is my arm broken?

480
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,511
No.

481
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:25,916
You're gonna have a bruise for a while.

482
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:28,510
Okay. Well, thank you so much, Abbe.
We're gonna...

483
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,001
No, no. No.

484
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:31,559
That's not how this works.

485
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:33,674
You came to my house.
You're my responsibility.

486
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,080
What does that mean?

487
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:37,539
That means you make yourself comfortable

488
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:39,697
and I call your father to pick you up.

489
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:47,838
<i>You've reached Jo Evans.
Please leave a message.</i>

490
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,510
- What's that?
- Geez!

491
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,812
That, uh...

492
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:55,643
That is the Chief's vehicle,

493
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,501
still parked at the bus terminal.

494
00:26:57,526 --> 00:26:59,760
And both their phones
are going to voicemail.

495
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:02,890
Wilkis wants them off the grid.

496
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,624
Hey, um, how hard would it
be for you to locate

497
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:09,041
one of those, uh, fitness trackers?

498
00:27:09,457 --> 00:27:10,556
You're right.

499
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,494
Action Jeeves wears one of those.

500
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,330
Yeah, okay, I don't...
I don't hate the nickname.

501
00:27:15,355 --> 00:27:17,486
Um... do you think you could find it?

502
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,526
Uh... yeah.

503
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,838
All right, then. Get in there.

504
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,271
Action Jeeves.

505
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:32,109
G.I. Jeeves.

506
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,901
G.I. Jeeves with the kung fu grip.

507
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,259
- Leave.
- Yep.

508
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,638
What are we looking at?

509
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,127
It's a neural network.

510
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:46,394
A programming paradigm that
allows a computer to learn.

511
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:51,752
You should destroy it immediately.

512
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:53,440
Hey, that...

513
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,498
That's a little girl.

514
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:57,432
She's smart...

515
00:27:57,457 --> 00:27:58,990
and funny.

516
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:01,476
She gets scared. She has empathy.

517
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,268
That's what you should fear.

518
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,846
She's constantly evolving.

519
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:06,804
She's constantly
changing her programming.

520
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,141
You think that makes her more human.

521
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:09,610
It doesn't. It makes her more dangerous.

522
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,367
Because we don't know where it ends.

523
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,822
I gave up everything...
My entire life...

524
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,567
So that this wouldn't happen.

525
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,907
Well, I mean... not everything.

526
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:20,378
I mean, let's be honest.
This place isn't exactly a hovel, is it?

527
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:22,463
This is a very lovely Bat Cave.

528
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:24,119
You think I want to live like this?

529
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:26,268
I-I tried to do the right thing.

530
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:28,593
I think you want to do the right thing,
Mr. Wilkis.

531
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:30,330
It's the follow-through that's lacking.

532
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,838
You can't even destroy
your own creation properly.

533
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,908
Piper isn't the danger. Kindred is.

534
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,519
So, help us stop him.

535
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,526
Piper is her name?

536
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:46,971
Yeah.

537
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:51,526
I think I have what you
need to get Kindred.

538
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,990
Prisoner transfer.

539
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:00,548
Come on in.

540
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,268
They had dinner.

541
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,664
Thank you. We owe you.

542
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:09,288
Uh, she's got a deep bruise on her arm.

543
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:12,725
So, ice and rest,
lay off volleyball for a week.

544
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,218
What'd she do?

545
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:16,546
Oh, well, the story is
she fell off the bike.

546
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,419
But she's lying through her teeth.

547
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:19,710
They both are.

548
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,799
They were doing something they
shouldn't have been doing.

549
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,060
Hmm.

550
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:24,282
I'll get it out of them.

551
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,339
Mm.

552
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:29,243
You hear about Ed?

553
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,511
Yeah.

554
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,223
Jo asked me to talk to him.

555
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,616
How'd that go?

556
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,429
Not good. Pretty bad.

557
00:29:36,454 --> 00:29:38,375
Sweet of you to try.

558
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:41,866
You are the weirdest divorced
couple I've ever met.

559
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,356
Mm.

560
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,851
Oh. You... You've got a plan.

561
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,022
- No! No.
- Oh.

562
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:50,656
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

563
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:52,975
- Just trying to help.
- Sure.

564
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,592
No, I... Uh, where are my two criminals?

565
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:04,193
In 2011, we were
pursuing the development

566
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:07,053
of nanotechnologies in gene therapy.

567
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:09,743
Kindred tasked me with
proving it worked.

568
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,635
That meant tests... on humans.

569
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,068
There was a village in Malawi.

570
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:18,093
They all volunteered,
and we paid them, but we knew...

571
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,767
... we knew before we started.

572
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,561
You knew what?

573
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,406
14 dead.

574
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:38,975
We paid off the families,
the government burnt the bodies,

575
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,662
and it never happened.

576
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,929
You're gonna burn for this, as well.

577
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:51,928
I know. I should.

578
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:00,663
There's someone in the elevator.

579
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,523
Where's my gun?

580
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:06,649
In my truck,
about 70 feet above our heads.

581
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,793
What are you doing?

582
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,890
- Shut down the elevators.
- I can't.

583
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,777
- Do you know whose bat that is?!
- I don't care.

584
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,046
Is there another exit?

585
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:21,171
Kindred will be sifting
through the ashes.

586
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:24,479
Follow me.

587
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:30,249
- Wait!
- ­No!

588
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:31,640
Just wait!

589
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,899
Go! Go!

590
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:35,490
Go, go, go, go, go!

591
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:41,258
- How far up?
- Seven stories.

592
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:42,554
Go! Go, go!

593
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,765
Keep going!

594
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,632
Jo!

595
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:13,853
Ears!

596
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,700
Come on!

597
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,261
Hey! Wait!

598
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,530
- He's right behind us!
- We're still here!

599
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,301
He's right behind us, Benny!

600
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,231
Okay.

601
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,112
Wait. Listen.

602
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:47,202
Do you hear that?

603
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,043
That's Chris.

604
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,160
That's Chris.

605
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:58,613
Okay.

606
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,320
Come on, now. Straight upstairs.

607
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,004
Pajamas, teeth, bed.

608
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,315
No talking, no nothing.

609
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,355
Hold on.

610
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:12,199
Phone.

611
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:14,629
Come on.

612
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,534
One week.

613
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,083
And that's me being nice.

614
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:22,128
Fine.

615
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:23,668
I'm sorry, what?

616
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,403
That's what I thought. Keep walking.

617
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,206
- Alex...
- Nope.

618
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,801
I don't want to see the puppy dog eyes,

619
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:32,327
and I don't want to hear the "Alex,
I'm so sorry" garbage.

620
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,586
All right? You're grounded, too.
Upstairs. Let's go.

621
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:36,370
Fine.

622
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:40,157
Welcome to the family.

623
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:52,547
<i>This is amazing.</i>

624
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,672
<i>Federal authorities arrested
Augur CEO Richard Kindred today,</i>

625
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:09,992
<i>charging him with wire fraud
and conspiracy to commit wire fraud,</i>

626
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,037
<i>in connection with medical
experiments officials...</i>

627
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:13,701
Ohh.

628
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:16,125
Wish I could've seen his face
when they knocked on his door.

629
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,256
Yeah.

630
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,317
Oh, come on. You're not happy?

631
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:23,125
I mean... wire fraud is not exactly

632
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,906
an accurate representation
of what the guy did.

633
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,422
He's facing 20 years.

634
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,140
Effectively the rest of his life.

635
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:32,257
Is there any word on Alan Wilkis?

636
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:35,029
APB is out to everyone within 100 miles.

637
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,038
If he surfaces, though, we'll, uh...
we'll know about it.

638
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:38,850
Yeah, I doubt we'll ever see him again.

639
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,311
Guy disappeared for four years.

640
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,359
He's got the IQ and the
means to do it again.

641
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,719
So, uh... I can go now... right?

642
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,334
Yeah.

643
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,787
Uh...

644
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,773
I didn't hate you all
as much as I expected.

645
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:56,173
Nice.

646
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:57,914
Real... Real nice.

647
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,383
Bye.

648
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:09,640
Buy you a drink?

649
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:11,117
Or seven?

650
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,867
Uh... no, thank you.

651
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,725
I think I'm gonna head home.

652
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,082
Okay.

653
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:17,507
See ya.

654
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,299
Hey.

655
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,342
Hey!

656
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:27,568
Where is everybody?

657
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:30,217
Uh, well, Mia's up doing her homework,

658
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:31,484
and Piper's up reading.

659
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:32,509
You're home early.

660
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:34,100
Yeah, well...

661
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,547
Richard Kindred is in federal custody.

662
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,100
Well, congratulations.

663
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:42,523
Guess we can put that behind us, huh?

664
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:44,531
Yeah. Looks like.

665
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,004
You know, I think
I might owe your ex an apology.

666
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,351
Said some pretty harsh stuff to him.

667
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:56,070
I'll make it right.

668
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:04,569
I've taken advantage of you, Dad.

669
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,139
No. What are you talking about?

670
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,781
I just assume that you'll be here to...

671
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,212
take care of the girls,

672
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,937
take care of the house, me.

673
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:18,140
I'm happy to do that stuff, you know.

674
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:20,459
I know it's selfish of me.

675
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:24,412
I want to keep you around.

676
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,256
I'm gonna be around
for as long as I can.

677
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:33,200
But what I don't want is to be broken...

678
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,789
be somebody that you
have to take care of.

679
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:38,631
I would do that, Dad.

680
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:40,264
I know you would. I do.

681
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,711
I'm... I'm just saying
that you don't have to.

682
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,411
I'm saying I want to be myself...

683
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:52,432
for as long as I can be.

684
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:57,942
Yeah.

685
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,466
Okay.

686
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,950
I have this memory of mom...

687
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,011
just before she left.

688
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:19,926
I had a...

689
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:23,095
a green coat with blue buttons.

690
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:25,134
My favorite coat.

691
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,433
And...

692
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,619
I had lost a button.

693
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:33,244
And somehow...

694
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:37,487
she found a perfect match.

695
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:40,770
And she fixed it.

696
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,731
And then later on...

697
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,943
after she was gone, I realized

698
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,217
that that was all part of the plan.

699
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,881
Fix the coat, say goodbye...

700
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,850
and leave.

701
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:07,334
Jo... your mom...

702
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,975
It's not the same.

703
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:13,053
I know it's not the same, Dad.

704
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:18,959
It just feels really familiar.

705
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:23,595
- Who's home?
- Hey.

706
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,852
We're in here.

707
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,998
Hey.

708
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:30,327
I know what's going on.

709
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,326
Watch this.

710
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:36,465
<i>This is amazing.</i>

711
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,090
Okay, what... What am I looking at here?

712
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,127
She can move things.

713
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,352
Ed, she's moving that with her mind.

714
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:42,504
What?!

715
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,247
Nah, it's gotta be some kind of a trick.

716
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:45,971
That is not a trick. This is real.

717
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:47,993
Can I see that?

718
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:49,270
Absolutely.

719
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,309
This all makes sense.

720
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,317
This is why these people
are chasing after her.

721
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:53,795
The girl has some type
of special powers.

722
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:54,873
No, they did wires

723
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,064
- or something...
- No. No! No. Ed, look...

724
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,990
Did you d... Did you delete it?

725
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,199
You knew?

726
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,194
Did anybody else see that video?

727
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,786
No. No one else has seen it.

728
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:13,811
How long have you known?

729
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,269
I was trying to keep her safe.

730
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:17,290
I was trying to keep everybody safe.

731
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,849
What else is there, Jo?

732
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,743
I can't tell you.

733
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:23,901
I can't.

734
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,200
If she finds out,

735
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:28,325
there's a good chance it
could be fatal for her.

736
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,028
That doesn't make any sense.

737
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,412
I know.

738
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,559
You're gonna have to trust me. Okay?

739
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,826
Trust you.

740
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,559
We have to trust you.

741
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:40,161
But you didn't trust us.

742
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:41,864
That's not true.

743
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:44,326
Can you guarantee Mia
won't get hurt again?

744
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:45,716
No.

745
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:48,240
I can't guarantee anything, Alex.

746
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:50,874
We could get hit by a bus tomorrow.

747
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,965
Can you guarantee

748
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,295
that Piper won't somehow
accidentally hurt my daughter?

749
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,933
No.

750
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,674
Then how can you expect
me to let Mia stay here?

751
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,239
You're right.

752
00:40:08,264 --> 00:40:09,380
I...

753
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:10,561
What...

754
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,100
Dad! I'm sorry!

755
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:19,731
It was my fault. It was not Piper's.

756
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,208
Mia, we're leaving. Let's go.

757
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,359
It's not forever, honey.

758
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:24,653
We just want to make sure
you don't get hurt again.

759
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:26,274
She didn't do anything wrong.

760
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,020
- Please.
- Shh.

761
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:30,022
It's okay. Okay.

762
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:32,649
I'll call you tomorrow.

763
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,142
I love you.

764
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,167
Come on.

765
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,585
Piper?

766
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,099
What happened?

767
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:23,289
Mia got hurt...

768
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:26,334
because I showed her what I can do.

769
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,713
And now everybody is scared.

770
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:31,693
Well, that's very sad.

771
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,518
But people are like that.

772
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:37,099
Scared of what they don't understand.

773
00:41:37,124 --> 00:41:40,670
You know, you can always
be yourself with me.

774
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,223
But you're not who you say you are.

775
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:49,025
What do you mean?

776
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,725
You lied.

777
00:41:58,209 --> 00:41:59,545
Sort of.

778
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:02,428
But really, it was a test.

779
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:06,264
And you did so well.

780
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:12,483
What happens now?

781
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:14,022
Now?

782
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,617
We get to have fun.
