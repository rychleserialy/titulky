So, what's up?
You keeping an eye on us?

180
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:39,057
Just minding my own business.

181
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:40,591
Yeah, so am I.

182
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,961
Hey! Best buds already.

183
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,363
Melts my heart.

184
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:48,947
Mind if I cut in?

185
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:01,611
Used to be MS-13 littered
this place with corpses.

186
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,847
Now it's these Corto Maltese.

187
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,950
Last month,
I had to deport seven of 'em.

188
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,086
Got a punctured lung
as a parting gift.

189
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,221
Sorry for throwing you in
with animals,

190
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,655
but I had to make a point.

191
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,458
Now, let's bypass the bullshit
and get down to business.

192
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,260
Okay.

193
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,429
So, no hard feelings?

194
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,898
Sure.

195
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:23,768
Believe me, I had your back.

196
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:24,869
Let me get that single
ready for you.

197
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:28,304
Move you out of the jungle.

198
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,573
Hey.

199
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,710
What's up?

200
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,577
Don't.

201
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm not helping you.

202
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,783
-You said we were good.
-We are.

203
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:43,817
And I'm not helping you...
or anybody. It's not personal.

204
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,490
You fucking with me again?

205
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:48,125
No.

206
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,794
So you wanna be in there?

207
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,778
That's right.

208
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:02,807
You know what happens
to the cop who's in cahoots
with the boss?

209
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,278
Nothing good. [laughs]

210
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:10,461
Enjoy your stay, kid.

211
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:43,458
[inmates grunting and groaning]

212
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:47,184
[inmate exclaims and gasps]

213
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,386
-Rent is due, motherfucker!
-We don't want any problems!

214
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:52,056
Too late!
You left the family.

215
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,326
They'll slice you up
when you get home.

216
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,462
Or we'll slice you up now.

217
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:03,145
Or you pay the rent.
Your call.

218
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:04,835
We'll do it.

219
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,937
-Rafi, no!
-Shut the fuck up.

220
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,807
-I said we'll do it. Who?
-[groaning] Rafi.

221
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,677
Your new celly. The cop.

222
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,480
-Why him?
-'Cause he's a cop,
motherfucker!

223
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:21,514
You saw him in the yard.
He's down with the guards.

224
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,288
Twelve hours, <i>puto.</i>

225
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,725
[barks]

226
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,496
Great. Dumbest dog ever.

227
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,298
He can ring a doorbell
with his nose.

228
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:08,532
I've seen dumber.

229
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:12,566
-[barks]
-Stay away from me.

230
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,411
What you did to those cops...

231
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:23,682
You messed things up
for a lot of people,
including me.

232
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:26,584
I think I deserve an answer.
What the hell happened?

233
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:30,122
When you invited me
to be a Titan,
I told you what I was.

234
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,423
But you didn't listen
'cause that's not what
you wanted to hear.

235
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:35,693
You're right.
I didn't listen.

236
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:40,596
Being a Titan
isn't about being perfect.

237
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:41,632
I...

238
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:44,434
I killed a guy once.

239
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:48,205
And I clawed him to pieces.

240
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,474
So, maybe we should both
be locked up.

241
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:55,508
What we do...
Other people count on us
to help them.

242
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,048
Well, they shouldn't.

243
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:02,819
[barking]

244
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,056
[tires squeal]

245
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:08,459
You gotta get
out of here. Now!

246
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:12,864
No, no, no!
Do you really want
to hurt somebody else?

247
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:17,067
-[Krypto continues barking]
-[soldier] Move, move!
Come on, now!

248
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,469
Come on.

249
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:21,571
[soldier] Move, move!

250
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:22,636
[woman scoffs]

251
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,613
Mmm. Mmm,
these lemon things
are delicious.

252
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,648
They get all their food
from the Ritz Carlton
down the street.

253
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:34,919
Leftovers from big
muckity-muck conventions.

254
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,751
Bon appetit.

255
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:45,529
So, what brings you
to this fine ding
establishment?

256
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,865
Sorry, that was...
Uh, you don't have
to answer that.

257
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:52,269
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

258
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:55,105
I left.

259
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,407
My family's fucked up.

260
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,444
Yeah, can't relate.

261
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:03,413
You look at
all these grown-ups,
and you...

262
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:05,450
You think
that they have the answers.

263
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:09,287
Then you find out
they just have no idea.

264
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,689
I think it's a test.

265
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:15,092
The longer we don't break free,
the dumber we are.

266
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,996
Mmm. Sixteen years.

267
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:21,465
That's like a D-minus for me.

268
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:24,101
Have you ever heard
of a Labord's chameleon?

269
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,435
Can't say I have.

270
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,439
It's a lizard species
in Madagascar.

271
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:30,340
The females lay their eggs
before the winter

272
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:33,411
and then all the adults
die before they hatch.

273
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:36,180
So, from the minute
you're born, no parents.

274
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,949
You're totally on your own.

275
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:42,051
Yeah. Only downside is,
your life span's
only five months.

276
00:19:42,086 --> 00:19:44,489
And you're, uh,
green and scaly.

277
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:49,359
But... you're totally free,
all your life.

278
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,461
No rules, no bullshit.

279
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,298
No adults fucking you up.

280
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:59,332
[scoffs] We should
have been lizards.

281
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:04,342
Time to go.

282
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,809
You don't have to.

283
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:10,443
Mind your business, kid.

284
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,853
It's okay.

285
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,270
You disappear on me again,
I'll fucking kill you.

286
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:36,707
Why wait?

287
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,778
Fine.

288
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,481
[groans]

289
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:47,917
I'm not a kid.

290
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,451
[groaning]

291
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:59,195
[straining]

292
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,366
Please, don't kill me.

293
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:07,601
Please... Please...
[grunts]

294
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:16,747
[Rachel gasping]

295
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,279
[exclaims]

296
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,069
I'm sorry.

297
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:44,104
Being a lizard would be
considerably less freaky.

298
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,858
You're fucking awesome.

299
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:07,696
[snarling]

300
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,807
[panting]

301
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,191
Oh, shit.

302
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,317
[gargoyle growling]

303
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,419
[exclaiming and yelling]

304
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:33,324
-No! No! [screams]
-[gargoyle screeching]

305
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:37,094
[indistinct chatter over radio]

306
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:40,498
[dominos clacking]

307
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,080
[shiv scratching]

308
00:22:56,547 --> 00:23:01,419
When's the escape?

309
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:04,521
I saw you looking
at the guards at the gate.

310
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:08,558
So, you ratted us out, huh?

311
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:12,063
If I did,
you'd all be in solitary.

312
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:14,298
If I can see what you're up to,
soon enough, they will.

313
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:16,835
The fucking snitch
giving us tips?

314
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,038
Just facts.
Four guards on the ground.

315
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,407
Two in the tower with M14s
with 20 rounds each.

316
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:26,678
-You got no chance.
-Yeah.

317
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:29,013
You're so smart, huh?

318
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:34,047
Why don't you tell us
how we're gonna stay alive?

319
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,285
I'd kill me.

320
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,094
[sighs]

321
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,890
I could fucking kill you.

322
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:16,760
Make it easier on all of us.

323
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,096
But that's not who I am.

324
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:20,531
We're not murders.

325
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:23,768
That's why we left
the Corto Maltese
and tried to go clean.

326
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,071
Immigration picked us up.
And they're gonna deport us.

327
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,040
At home, we're deserters,
just like in here.

328
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:35,046
So, the Corto Maltese
will slaughter us like pigs.

329
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,682
We have no choice
but to break out.

330
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:41,652
So, unless
you have real answers...

331
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:44,201
shut the fuck up.

332
00:24:57,035 --> 00:25:00,170
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

333
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,170
Yeah.

334
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:11,310
Hey. You know they're gonna
keep coming after me, right?

335
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,684
Let them try.

336
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,632
This is my mess,
not yours.

337
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:18,689
This is what the Titans do.

338
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:22,000
We have each other's backs.

339
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,026
So, where are they?
The other Titans.

340
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:29,567
You know what,
maybe I should do

341
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,636
what Dick wanted me to do
in the first place.

342
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,805
Call in the big guns.

343
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:35,339
We're gonna use guns?

344
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:40,373
No, it's just a metaphor.
Calling Bruce Wayne.

345
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:44,013
[automated voice]
Zone six, unauthorized access.

346
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:44,781
What's that?

347
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:47,932
Zone six is the roof.

348
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:51,555
[soldier 1] Hurry, now!

349
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:52,722
Everybody down on the floor!

350
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:54,326
[soldier 2] Stay where you are!

351
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:57,227
-[soldier 1] Hands,
let me see your hands!
-[soldier 2] Don't move!

Screw this. I'm switching
to Kryptonite bullets.

00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:53,448
No! No Kryptonite!

It's okay.

382
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,275
I'm not here to hurt you.

383
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,278
Who are you?

384
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,146
My name is Mercy Graves,
I work with Eve Watson.

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,150
Eve?

386
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:27,550
Is she here?

387
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:31,288
No, she sent me instead.

389
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:42,299
It's okay.

390
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:45,502
It's just tranquilizers
to calm him.

391
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,738
I'm here to help you.

392
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,941
That's not what it feels like.

393
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:52,910
Do you want to hurt me?

394
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,811
I'm not sure.

395
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,580
Did you want to hurt
those police officers?

396
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,915
I don't know.
I don't think so.

397
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,951
These are not...

398
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:03,753
easy questions, Conner.

399
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:06,124
Let us help you.

400
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:09,826
After all, we created you.

401
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:12,630
We can fix you.

402
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:13,897
"Fix"?

403
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:16,534
What's happening to you,
it's our fault.

404
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:17,801
An imbalance
we didn't consider,

405
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:19,670
but now that we understand it,

406
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:23,641
we can stop it.

407
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,411
All you have to do...

408
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:29,394
is come home.

What is this place?

412
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,038
I've brought someone
who can help us.

[indistinct conversations]

414
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:42,752
Hey, hey.

415
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,188
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

416
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:45,890
We've been here all morning.

417
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:49,526
-I'm bored.
-Well, bored's
better than dead.

418
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,728
Take a nap.

419
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,861
I'm not tired.

420
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,708
Neither are they.

421
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,443
We stick together
till tonight.

422
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,012
It's a suicide mission.

423
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:10,114
We're gonna make it.

424
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:13,550
Will you shut the fuck up,
all of you?

425
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,919
[Luis] It's not suicide.

426
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,299
You think
we can't beat the guards

427
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:17,354
with their guns,

428
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:18,788
but we can.

429
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:22,826
You know why?

430
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,028
Alazul.

431
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,164
You know Alazul?

432
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:29,534
In our village,
Alazul is our hero.

433
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:31,935
He lives between the moon
and the stars.

434
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:33,171
And in the time
of greatest need,

435
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:35,406
he flies down and saves you.

436
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,141
A bird that comes in the night
and saves people?

437
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:39,309
Yes.

438
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:41,045
He's gonna save us tonight...

439
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:42,846
and we'll be free.

440
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,481
Okay, Luis...

441
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:45,481
there's no Alazul.

442
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:46,384
Yes, there is.

443
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:47,317
[Dick] Then why are you here?

444
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:48,420
The gangs that came after you,

445
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,255
Immigration
that came after you.

446
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:51,689
This bird's
supposed to save you?

447
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:53,758
Where the hell has he been?

448
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:54,724
Huh?

449
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:56,826
He's real.

450
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,494
And tonight...

451
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:02,066
he's gonna save us.

452
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,750
You'll see.

453
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:22,734
You'll see.

454
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,328
[Walter]
Subject 13 is in stasis.

455
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,430
[Mercy] I'll call Mr. Luthor

456
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,098
to get instructions
on recalibration.

457
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,267
How's our other guest?

458
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,136
Well, I'd like to say
all bark and no bite,

459
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,819
but I wouldn't put
money on it.

00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:52,317
Mr. Logan. I'm Mercy Graves.

462
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:54,618
It's an honor to meet you.

463
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:57,020
Can I interest you
in something else to eat?

464
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:58,189
Grass-fed ribeye?

465
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,092
Chia pudding?
Name anything you'd like.

466
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,227
How about
letting me out of here?

467
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,596
I'm afraid
that's not available
on DoorDash.

[Gar chuckles]

469
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,000
What have you done
to Conner?

470
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:11,868
Exactly as he wanted.

471
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:12,869
We didn't force him
to come back.

472
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,403
It was his choice.

473
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:15,673

474
00:32:15,707 --> 00:32:18,642

are all about

My apologies
for any discomfort.

00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:23,548
We just wanted
to contain your transformation

478
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,483
to ensure
we had the opportunity to talk.

479
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:30,721
[exhales] Let me guess,
you guys can "fix" me, too.

480
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:32,022
No.

481
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:34,424
But I could help you.

482
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:39,459
I could offer you
what Niles Caulder never did.

483
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,268
Dr. Caulder
and CADMUS Industries

484
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:49,006
have crossed paths
from time to time.

485
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,041
He's a brilliant man.

486
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:54,178
Though,
not entirely altruistic,

487
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:56,680
no matter how he wishes
to appear.

488
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,848
He saved you.

489
00:32:58,848 --> 00:32:59,916
Gave you the gift of life,

490
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,919
but only as it suited
his needs.

491
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:06,356
His purpose.

492
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:08,192
Did he ever ask you
what you want,

493
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:10,060
for yourself?

494
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:12,329
Has anyone?

495
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:15,266
Or do they just
string you along...

496
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,468
using you for their own ends,

497
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,270
with little concern for you
or your welfare?

498
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:23,708
CADMUS will focus on you.

to their fullest.

536
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,853
Santos being killed...

537
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:57,320
that's your sign saying,
don't do this.

538
00:36:57,355 --> 00:37:01,625
If you can't see that,
you're blind.

539
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:03,157
I'm blind?

540
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,168
If God wants me dead,

541
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:13,403
then it'll be my time.

542
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,239
But if I'm
still alive tomorrow,

543
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,740
then that's my sign.

544
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,443
And it means that I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

545
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:21,878
Now, he's giving me
a chance...

546
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:24,548
to be something else.

547
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:29,532
Maybe you're the one
who's blind.

551

Rise and shine, boys.

552
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:01,652
It's 6:00 a.m.

553
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:03,286
Say goodbye to America.

554
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,358
Hope you had a nice stay.

[guard] Sit tight.

557
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:37,789
All right,
we just need to get
the receiver's signature

558
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:42,293
on the transport manifesto.

[handcuffs clicking]

560
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:47,431
All right, load 'em up.

[handcuffs clicking]

562
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,369
[guard] Time to go, gentlemen.

563

-On your feet.
-[door creaking]

564
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:08,318

[Len grunts] Hey.

576
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:12,550
-Cuff him!

[traffic in distance]

581
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:25,257
I spoke to Mr. Luthor.

582
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:30,289
There have been some changes
regarding Subject 13
and Project Rakshasa.

583
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:33,097
With all due respect,
Ms. Graves,

584
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,532
I don't answer to you.

585
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:36,333
Well,
that's one of the changes.

586
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:40,972
Now you do.

587
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:42,806
[Walter] What do we do
about him?

588
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,876
[Mercy] He says
he wants to be a Titan,

589
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:48,411
reunited with his team.

590
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:53,096
I think it's an excellent idea.
